# RO-PUF
Designed a basic Ring Oscillator (RO) PUF on FPGA to generate unique device-specific keys. The system includes gated ROs, control FSM, counters, synchronizers, Hamming encoder/decoder, and ILA interface. Final stable key is derived with built-in error correction for secure hardware authentication.
